M=C4=81ori advocates say a review of the electoral system does not go far=
 enough to address inequities.

The review has identified several areas where M=C4=81ori are disenfranchis=
ed. They include a lack of understanding about the M=C4=81ori roll and how=
 it works=2C restrictions on prisoner voting=2C and high disengagement.

Victoria University associate professor and review co-chair=2C Maria Bargh=
=2C says it is a massive opportunity for change and the question of how th=
e system upholds Te Tiriti o Waitangi is central.

But advocate and political commentator Te Matahiapo Safari Hynes says what=
 was needed was transformation=2C not tinkering.

Scientist's dairy factory concerns over unsafe drinking water

A scientist says Waimate's drinking water nitrate contamination could be l=
inked to recent changes in land use=2C including wastewater discharge from=
 Oceania Dairy's factory in South Canterbury.

Since August=2C 615 residents using the Lower Waihao Rural Water Scheme's=
 water have been warned against drinking tap water due to high nitrate lev=
els. (https://radionz.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D211a938dcf3e634b=

The Waimate District Council previously suggested flooding in the region w=
as to blame=2C and Environment Canterbury thinks it is unlikely the dairy=
 factory is a factor.

But University of Otago public health specialist Dr Tim Chambers says: "It=
 looks like the Oceania Dairy Factory could be playing a part."

Cost of dental care

A new report has found 40 percent of New Zealanders - and half of M=C4=81o=
ri and Pasifika people - can't afford dental care (https://radionz.us6.lis=

A quarter of a million New Zealanders every year have to have a tooth pull=
ed out because their decay is so bad.

The senior dentists union is calling for free universal dental care.

Aucklanders spoken to by RNZ were unanimous in their support (https://radi=

Spy agency uses 'computer network exploitation' to take digital informatio=
n

One of the country's two spy agencies has revealed it retrieves informatio=
n directly from where it is stored or processed on computers.

The "computer network exploitation" operations have been a highly classifi=
ed secret at the GCSB until now.

US commentators refer to computer network exploitation as a form of cyber=
 warfare (https://radionz.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D211a938dcf3e=

Albatross eggs disappear from colony

An investigation is underway into the disappearance of four northern royal=
 albatross eggs from a colony near Dunedin.

The discovery was made on Thursday morning during routine checks at Taiaro=
a Head.

DOC coastal Otago operations manager Annie Wallace says it is strange for=
 eggs to disappear without a trace as the colony had been managed and moni=
tored for years.
